# IM Team Page Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

### To Do:
- Add a post-install prompt to select layout style (shortcode doesn't work until a setting is saved)
- Add setting to toggle default CSS on/off (/func/[option + shortcode].php)
- For the love of Christ, clean up (/assets/team.css). It's fugly.
